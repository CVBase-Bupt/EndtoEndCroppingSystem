# End-to-End Cropping System

This is an offical implemenation for 
**An End-to-End Neural Network for Image Cropping by Learning Composition from Aesthetic Photos**.

Given a source image, our algorithm could take actions step by step to find almost the best cropping window on source image.

## Get Start
Install the python libraries. (See Requirements).

Download the code from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/CVBase-Bupt/EndtoEndCroppingSystem.git

cd EndtoEndCroppingSystem
```

Run the python script:
```
python demo.py [your image path]
```
Before you run, please download our pre-trained models.We have released 6 models based on different scale (224,384,512) and ratio (square or not). If you want to use any of them, just:

password:la52

Put the weight file under the dirctory ```weights```

Fix the config file ```models/config.py```, change the ```self.ratio``` and ```self.scale``` in the  ```__init__```function. 

## Requirement

Python

keras(we use version 2.2.4)

tensorflow 1.13.1

opencv-python 2.4.9
